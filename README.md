# project_imhof

A project we made in first year of Bachelor at EPFL in groups of two. The project was named Imhof in honor to the swiss cartograph Eduard Imhof. The program takes as input a flat map and OpenStreetMaps coordinates containing the height at each position and outputs the map with a 3d like representation showing all the relief.
